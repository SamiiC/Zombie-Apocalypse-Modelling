# Zombie Apocalypse Modelling ðŸ§Ÿ <br />
A program that visualises how a zombie apocalypse would turn out with modifiable parameters  <br />
There are different parameters so you can see how to get the population to survive the longest ( Or shortest ðŸ˜¥ )   <br />
Or get zombies to takeover the world as fast as possible <br />
Visualisation through matplotlib
