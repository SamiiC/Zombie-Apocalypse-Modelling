# Zombie Apocalypse Modelling 🧟 <br />
A program that visualises how a zombie apocalypse would turn out with modifiable parameters using differential equations  <br />
There are different parameters so you can see how to get the population to survive the longest ( Or shortest 😥 ).    <br />
Or get zombies to takeover the world as fast as possible <br />
On default parameters zombies win in 30 days <br />
Visualisation through matplotlib
